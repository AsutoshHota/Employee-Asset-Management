# Project Overview 
Employee Asset Management is a custom Odoo 16 module designed to help companies efficiently manage assets issued to employees. It provides HR with the ability to assign, track, and reclaim assets such as laptops, phones, and ID cards.

The module includes full integration with Odoo’s HR system and provides a user-friendly interface for viewing, updating, and managing asset lifecycle events. The system enforces role-based access control, supports workflow states (e.g., assigned, returned, lost), and is structured using best practices in Odoo development.

It covers core components of Odoo’s architecture including models, views, access controls, workflows, and business logic, making it a complete, modular asset management solution.
